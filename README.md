# Listary Java

Listary Java is a **shopping list application** developed as a university project, similar to a **capstone project**, but not at that level. The app was built using **Java** and **XML** for Android development, with **Firebase Authentication** for user management and **Firestore** as the database.  

This project was developed by a team of **four** and includes documentation following the **RUP (Rational Unified Process)** model.

> **Note:** The repository is somewhat messy, as this was one of the first projects we worked on.

## Features

- User authentication with **Firebase Authentication**  
- Shopping list creation and management  
- Data storage using **Firestore**  
- Multiple **diagrams and documentation files** following RUP standards  
- Simple UI for easy usability  

## Documentation

The project includes several documents located in the **Documents** folder:

- **Use Case Diagram**  
- **Class Diagram**  
- **Entity Diagram**  
- **Use Case Specification**  
- **Requirements Specification**  
- **RUP Model Documentation**  

## Technologies Used

- **Java** (Android development)  
- **XML** (UI design)  
- **Firebase Authentication** (User authentication)  
- **Firestore** (Database for storing shopping lists)  
- **RUP (Rational Unified Process)** (Project documentation methodology)  

## Installation & Setup

Since this is an old project, it may require adjustments to work with the latest versions of Android and Firebase.

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio  
- Java Development Kit (JDK)  
- Firebase project with Authentication and Firestore enabled
